# Text-based World Memory Idea

The concept is to create a text-based open world where the model narrates player actions and updates the environment dynamically. Instead of relying solely on conversation history, the system maintains an external world state so persistent elements, like a planted tree, continue to grow and evolve over time without hitting memory limits. This idea can be expanded to multiplayer.
